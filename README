These are two projects I did during my Master's Education.

***The first ECAT, which stands for Enhancing Communication Across TWC.*** 

In this project I created a system where department heads and any specified individuals could put announcements for upcoming changes. These announcements would create an RSS feed and push this information out to any subscribers. 

This project integrates RSS, XML, HTML, CSS, PHP and Javascript to create a dynamic real time application.


***The second directory HERALD is my final project for my Master's Degree.***

It is a system similar to Facebook but also a bit like Twitter that allows the college staff, students and community to post events and notifications to the community. I labeled it the 
St. Rose Herald: College of Saint Rose Community Portal and added features like sms reminders and email capabilities. There is also a real time messaging system that pushes and pulls messages in real time to the end users.

This project uses PHP, HTML, CSS and Javascript.
